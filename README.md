# Analytics Engine

This project aims to leverage machine learning algorithms to predict the label of a response variable based on a diverse dataset. Through comprehensive data cleaning, visualization, modeling, and analysis, this work explores the effectiveness of different classifiers and their suitability for handling mixed data types and complexities inherent in the dataset.

## Introduction

The project utilizes a dataset consisting of 1396 observations across 16 columns, featuring a mix of numerical values, categorical data, and text strings. The primary goal is to predict a categorical target variable, posing a classification challenge. The dataset's variety calls for meticulous data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare it for machine learning models.

## Data Cleaning

The data cleaning process included handling missing/empty values, normalizing numeric columns, removing inconsistencies, assigning correct data types, and implementing one-hot encoding for categorical variables. These steps were crucial to ensure the integrity and usability of the dataset for analysis and modeling.

## Data Visualization

Two key visualizations were created to aid in understanding the dataset:
- A pie chart showing the distribution of participants across various sports.
- A scatter plot illustrating the relationship (or lack thereof) between two numerical variables.

These visualizations provide insights into the popularity of different sports and the correlation between numerical features.

## Modeling

Three classifiers were used in this project:
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
- Decision Tree

No additional parameters were adjusted for these models. The performance of each model was compared using k-fold validation, focusing on accuracy and standard deviation of accuracy as key metrics.

## Analysis

The analysis delves into why certain classifiers performed better than others, the consideration of evaluation metrics beyond accuracy, the continuous need for thorough data cleaning, the statistical significance between classifiers, and the potential for parameter tweaking to enhance model performance.

## Conclusion

The project highlighted the importance of data preprocessing, model selection, and parameter tuning in building robust predictive models. Logistic Regression demonstrated the highest mean accuracy, indicating its strong fit for the dataset used. Areas for further investigation include more advanced ensemble methods and a detailed examination of model performance on separate training and test sets.

## Extra Credit

An additional dataset from Kaggle, comprising the artist, song name, and length of top 100 billboard hip-hop songs, was analyzed. This section follows a similar structure, emphasizing data cleaning, visualization, and modeling but focuses on understanding factors influencing the popularity of music tracks.
Given the context of your project and the uploaded Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`), let's draft the **Installation** and **Usage** sections for the README.md, assuming the notebook includes code and instructions relevant to your machine learning project. 

## Installation

To run the Jupyter notebook and execute the project's code, you'll need to have Python installed on your system, along with several key libraries used in data analysis and machine learning tasks. Here's how to set up your environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.8 or newer installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (optional, but recommended): Create a virtual environment to manage the project's dependencies separately from your system-wide Python packages. In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory and run:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv myenv
    ```
    Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
      ```cmd
      myenv\Scripts\activate.bat
      ```
    - On Unix or MacOS:
      ```bash
      source myenv/bin/activate
      ```

3. **Install Required Libraries**: Install all necessary libraries using `pip`. The core libraries include `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, and `seaborn` for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning. Install these by running:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn
    ```

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**: If you don't have Jupyter installed, you can install it via pip:
    ```bash
    pip install notebook
    ```
    Start Jupyter Notebook by running:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    This command will open a new tab in your web browser where you can navigate to and open the `assignment.ipynb` notebook.

## Usage

To use the notebook and interact with the project's code, follow these steps:

1. **Open the Notebook**: After launching Jupyter Notebook (see Installation step 4), navigate through the interface to find `assignment.ipynb` and click to open it.

2. **Execute the Cells**: You can run each cell in the notebook by selecting it and pressing `Shift + Enter` or by using the play button in the toolbar. It's recommended to run the cells in order, especially for sections that build upon previous steps (like data cleaning before modeling).

3. **Adjust Parameters**: Feel free to tweak model parameters or data cleaning steps to see how they affect the outcomes. The notebook should include comments or documentation for guidance.

4. **Visualizations and Results**: The notebook includes sections for data visualization and model evaluation. Explore these to gain insights into the dataset and the performance of different classifiers.

5. **Experiment and Learn**: Use the notebook as a learning tool. Experiment with different machine learning algorithms, visualization techniques, and data preprocessing methods to enhance your understanding and improve the project's results.

This structure provides a comprehensive guide for setting up the project environment and navigating through the notebook. It encourages users to explore and learn from the project by experimenting with its components.
